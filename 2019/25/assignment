--- Day 25: Cryostasis ---

   As you approach Santa's ship, your sensors report two important
   details:

   First, that you might be too late: the internal temperature is -40
   degrees .

   Second, that one faint life signature is somewhere on the ship.

   The airlock door is locked with a code; your best option is to send in
   a small droid to investigate the situation. You attach your ship to
   Santa's, break a small hole in the hull, and let the droid run in
   before you seal it up again. Before your ship starts freezing, you
   detach your ship and set it to automatically stay within range of
   Santa's ship.

   This droid can follow basic instructions and report on its
   surroundings; you can communicate with it through an [1]Intcode program
   (your puzzle input) running on an [2]ASCII-capable computer.

   As the droid moves through its environment, it will describe what it
   encounters. When it says Command? , you can give it a single
   instruction terminated with a newline (ASCII code `10`). Possible
   instructions are:
     * Movement via `north`, `south`, `east`, or `west`.
     * To take an item the droid sees in the environment, use the command
       `take <name of item>`. For example, if the droid reports seeing a
       `red ball`, you can pick it up with `take red ball`.
     * To drop an item the droid is carrying, use the command `drop <name
       of item>`. For example, if the droid is carrying a `green ball`, you
       can drop it with `drop green ball`.
     * To get a list of all of the items the droid is currently carrying,
       use the command `inv` (for "inventory").

   Extra spaces or other characters aren't allowed - instructions must be
   provided precisely.

   Santa's ship is a Reindeer-class starship ; these ships use
   pressure-sensitive floors to determine the identity of droids and crew
   members. The standard configuration for these starships is for all
   droids to weigh exactly the same amount to make them easier to detect.
   If you need to get past such a sensor, you might be able to reach the
   correct weight by carrying items from the environment.

   Look around the ship and see if you can find the password for the main
   airlock .
