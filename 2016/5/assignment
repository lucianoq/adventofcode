--- Day 5: How About a Nice Game of Chess? ---

   You are faced with a security door designed by Easter Bunny engineers
   that seem to have acquired most of their security knowledge by watching
   [1]hacking [2]movies .

   The eight-character password for the door is generated one character at
   a time by finding the [3]MD5 hash of some Door ID (your puzzle input)
   and an increasing integer index (starting with 0 ).

   A hash indicates the next character in the password if its
   [4]hexadecimal representation starts with five zeroes . If it does, the
   sixth character in the hash is the next character of the password.

   For example, if the Door ID is abc :
     * The first index which produces a hash that starts with five zeroes
       is 3231929 , which we find by hashing abc3231929 ; the sixth
       character of the hash, and thus the first character of the
       password, is 1 .
     * 5017308 produces the next interesting hash, which starts with
       000008f82... , so the second character of the password is 8 .
     * The third time a hash starts with five zeroes is for abc5278568 ,
       discovering the character f .

   In this example, after continuing this search a total of eight times,
   the password is 18f47a30 .

   Given the actual Door ID, what is the password ?
