--- Day 6: Signals and Noise ---

   Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your
   signal is only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this
   is to switch to a simple [1]repetition code to get the message through.

   In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly. You've recorded the
   repeating message signal (your puzzle input), but the data seems quite
   corrupted - almost too badly to recover. Almost .

   All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for
   each position. For example, suppose you had recorded the following
   messages:

   eedadn
drvtee
eandsr
raavrd
atevrs
tsrnev
sdttsa
rasrtv
nssdts
ntnada
svetve
tesnvt
vntsnd
vrdear
dvrsen
enarar


   The most common character in the first column is e ; in the second, a ;
   in the third, s , and so on. Combining these characters returns the
   error-corrected message, easter .

   Given the recording in your puzzle input, what is the error-corrected
   version of the message being sent?
