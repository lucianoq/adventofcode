--- Day 22: Grid Computing ---

   You gain access to a massive storage cluster arranged in a grid; each
   storage node is only connected to the four nodes directly adjacent to
   it (three if the node is on an edge, two if it's in a corner).

   You can directly access data only on node /dev/grid/node-x0-y0 , but
   you can perform some limited actions on the other nodes:
     * You can get the disk usage of all nodes (via [1]df ). The result of
       doing this is in your puzzle input.
     * You can instruct a node to move (not copy) all of its data to an
       adjacent node (if the destination node has enough space to receive
       the data). The sending node is left empty after this operation.

   Nodes are named by their position: the node named node-x10-y10 is
   adjacent to nodes node-x9-y10 , node-x11-y10 , node-x10-y9 , and
   node-x10-y11 .

   Before you begin, you need to understand the arrangement of data on
   these nodes. Even though you can only move data between directly
   connected nodes, you're going to need to rearrange a lot of the data to
   get access to the data you need. Therefore, you need to work out how
   you might be able to shift data around.

   To do this, you'd like to count the number of viable pairs of nodes. A
   viable pair is any two nodes (A,B), regardless of whether they are
   directly connected , such that:
     * Node A is not empty (its Used is not zero).
     * Nodes A and B are not the same node.
     * The data on node A (its Used ) would fit on node B (its Avail ).

   How many viable pairs of nodes are there?
