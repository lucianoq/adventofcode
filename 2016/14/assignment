--- Day 14: One-Time Pad ---

   In order to communicate securely with Santa while you're on this
   mission, you've been using a [1]one-time pad that you [2]generate using
   a pre-agreed algorithm . Unfortunately, you've run out of keys in your
   one-time pad, and so you need to generate some more.

   To generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by taking the
   [3]MD5 of a pre-arranged [4]salt (your puzzle input) and an increasing
   integer index (starting with 0 , and represented in decimal); the
   resulting MD5 hash should be represented as a string of lowercase
   hexadecimal digits.

   However, not all of these MD5 hashes are keys , and you need 64 new
   keys for your one-time pad. A hash is a key only if :
     * It contains three of the same character in a row, like 777 . Only
       consider the first such triplet in a hash.
     * One of the next 1000 hashes in the stream contains that same
       character five times in a row, like 77777 .

   Considering future hashes for five-of-a-kind sequences does not cause
   those hashes to be skipped; instead, regardless of whether the current
   hash is a key, always resume testing for keys starting with the very
   next hash.

   For example, if the pre-arranged salt is abc :
     * The first index which produces a triple is 18 , because the MD5
       hash of abc18 contains ...cc38887a5... . However, index 18 does not
       count as a key for your one-time pad, because none of the next
       thousand hashes (index 19 through index 1018 ) contain 88888 .
     * The next index which produces a triple is 39 ; the hash of abc39
       contains eee . It is also the first key: one of the next thousand
       hashes (the one at index 816) contains eeeee .
     * None of the next six triples are keys, but the one after that, at
       index 92 , is: it contains 999 and index 200 contains 99999 .
     * Eventually, index 22728 meets all of the criteria to generate the
       64 th key.

   So, using our example salt of abc , index 22728 produces the 64 th key.

   Given the actual salt in your puzzle input, what index produces your 64
   th one-time pad key?
