--- Day 4: Security Through Obscurity ---

   Finally, you come across an information kiosk with a list of rooms. Of
   course, the list is encrypted and full of decoy data, but the
   instructions to decode the list are barely hidden nearby. Better remove
   the decoy data first.

   Each room consists of an encrypted name (lowercase letters separated by
   dashes) followed by a dash, a sector ID, and a checksum in square
   brackets.

   A room is real (not a decoy) if the checksum is the five most common
   letters in the encrypted name, in order, with ties broken by
   alphabetization. For example:
     * aaaaa-bbb-z-y-x-123[abxyz] is a real room because the most common
       letters are a (5), b (3), and then a tie between x , y , and z ,
       which are listed alphabetically.
     * a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-987[abcde] is a real room because although the
       letters are all tied (1 of each), the first five are listed
       alphabetically.
     * not-a-real-room-404[oarel] is a real room.
     * totally-real-room-200[decoy] is not.

   Of the real rooms from the list above, the sum of their sector IDs is
   1514 .

   What is the sum of the sector IDs of the real rooms ?
