--- Day 2: Password Philosophy ---

   Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest
   way down to the coast from here is via [1]toboggan .

   The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad
   day. "Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!" You ask
   if you can take a look.

   Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the
   passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate
   Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.

   To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle
   input) of passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the
   corporate policy when that password was set .

   For example, suppose you have the following list:

   1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: ccccccccc


   Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password
   policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter
   must appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that
   the password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.

   In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg
   , is not; it contains no instances of b , but needs at least 1 . The
   first and third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c ,
   both within the limits of their respective policies.

   How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
