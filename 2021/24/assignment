--- Day 24: Arithmetic Logic Unit ---

   [1]Magic smoke starts leaking from the submarine's [2]arithmetic logic
   unit (ALU). Without the ability to perform basic arithmetic and logic
   functions, the submarine can't produce cool patterns with its Christmas
   lights!

   It also can't navigate. Or run the oxygen system.

   Don't worry, though - you probably have enough oxygen left to give you
   enough time to build a new ALU.

   The ALU is a four-dimensional processing unit: it has integer variables
   w , x , y , and z . These variables all start with the value 0 . The
   ALU also supports six instructions :
     * inp a - Read an input value and write it to variable a .
     * add a b - Add the value of a to the value of b , then store the
       result in variable a .
     * mul a b - Multiply the value of a by the value of b , then store
       the result in variable a .
     * div a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b , truncate the
       result to an integer, then store the result in variable a . (Here,
       "truncate" means to round the value toward zero.)
     * mod a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b , then store the
       remainder in variable a . (This is also called the [3]modulo
       operation.)
     * eql a b - If the value of a and b are equal, then store the value 1
       in variable a . Otherwise, store the value 0 in variable a .

   In all of these instructions, a and b are placeholders; a will always
   be the variable where the result of the operation is stored (one of w ,
   x , y , or z ), while b can be either a variable or a number. Numbers
   can be positive or negative, but will always be integers.

   The ALU has no jump instructions; in an ALU program, every instruction
   is run exactly once in order from top to bottom. The program halts
   after the last instruction has finished executing.

   (Program authors should be especially cautious; attempting to execute
   div with b=0 or attempting to execute mod with a<0 or b<=0 will cause
   the program to crash and might even damage the ALU . These operations
   are never intended in any serious ALU program.)

   For example, here is an ALU program which takes an input number,
   negates it, and stores it in x :

        inp x
        mul x -1


   Here is an ALU program which takes two input numbers, then sets z to 1
   if the second input number is three times larger than the first input
   number, or sets z to 0 otherwise:

        inp z
        inp x
        mul z 3
        eql z x

   Here is an ALU program which takes a non-negative integer as input,
   converts it into binary, and stores the lowest (1's) bit in z , the
   second-lowest (2's) bit in y , the third-lowest (4's) bit in x , and
   the fourth-lowest (8's) bit in w :

        inp w
        add z w
        mod z 2
        div w 2
        add y w
        mod y 2
        div w 2
        add x w
        mod x 2
        div w 2
        mod w 2

   Once you have built a replacement ALU, you can install it in the
   submarine, which will immediately resume what it was doing when the ALU
   failed: validating the submarine's model number . To do this, the ALU
   will run the MOdel Number Automatic Detector program (MONAD, your
   puzzle input).

   Submarine model numbers are always fourteen-digit numbers consisting
   only of digits 1 through 9 . The digit 0 cannot appear in a model
   number.

   When MONAD checks a hypothetical fourteen-digit model number, it uses
   fourteen separate inp instructions, each expecting a single digit of
   the model number in order of most to least significant. (So, to check
   the model number 13579246899999 , you would give 1 to the first inp
   instruction, 3 to the second inp instruction, 5 to the third inp
   instruction, and so on.) This means that when operating MONAD, each
   input instruction should only ever be given an integer value of at
   least 1 and at most 9 .

   Then, after MONAD has finished running all of its instructions, it will
   indicate that the model number was valid by leaving a 0 in variable z .
   However, if the model number was invalid , it will leave some other
   non-zero value in z .

   MONAD imposes additional, mysterious restrictions on model numbers, and
   legend says the last copy of the MONAD documentation was eaten by a
   [4]tanuki . You'll need to figure out what MONAD does some other way.

   To enable as many submarine features as possible, find the largest
   valid fourteen-digit model number that contains no 0 digits. What is
   the largest model number accepted by MONAD?

--- Part Two ---

   As the submarine starts booting up things like the [5]Retro Encabulator,
   you realize that maybe you don't need all these submarine features
   after all.

   What is the smallest model number accepted by MONAD?
