--- Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io ---
Santa's Accounting-Elves need help balancing the books after a recent order. Unfortunately, their accounting software uses a peculiar storage format. That's where you come in.

They have a JSON document which contains a variety of things: arrays ([1,2,3]), objects ({"a":1, "b":2}), numbers, and strings. Your first job is to simply find all of the numbers throughout the document and add them together.

For example:

- [1,2,3] and {"a":2,"b":4} both have a sum of 6.
- [[[3]]] and {"a":{"b":4},"c":-1} both have a sum of 3.
- {"a":[-1,1]} and [-1,{"a":1}] both have a sum of 0.
- [] and {} both have a sum of 0.

You will not encounter any strings containing numbers.

What is the sum of all numbers in the document?
