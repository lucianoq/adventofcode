--- Part Two ---

Uh oh - the Accounting-Elves have realized that they double-counted everything red.

Ignore any object (and all of its children) which has any property with the value "red". Do this only for objects ({...}), not arrays ([...]).

- [1,2,3] still has a sum of 6.
- [1,{"c":"red","b":2},3] now has a sum of 4, because the middle object is ignored.
- {"d":"red","e":[1,2,3,4],"f":5} now has a sum of 0, because the entire structure is ignored.
- [1,"red",5] has a sum of 6, because "red" in an array has no effect.
