--- Day 10: Knot Hash ---

   You come across some programs that are trying to implement a software
   emulation of a hash based on knot-tying. The hash these programs are
   implementing isn't very strong, but you decide to help them anyway. You
   make a mental note to remind the Elves later not to invent their own
   cryptographic functions .

   This hash function simulates tying a knot in a circle of string with
   256 marks on it. Based on the input to be hashed, the function
   repeatedly selects a span of string, brings the ends together, and
   gives the span a half-twist to reverse the order of the marks within
   it. After doing this many times, the order of the marks is used to
   build the resulting hash.

   To achieve this, begin with a list of numbers from 0 to 255 , a current
   position which begins at 0 (the first element in the list), a skip size
   (which starts at 0 ), and a sequence of lengths (your puzzle input).
   Then, for each length:
     * Reverse the order of that length of elements in the list , starting
       with the element at the current position .
     * Move the current position forward by that length plus the skip size
       .
     * Increase the skip size by one.

   The list is circular; if the current position and the length try to
   reverse elements beyond the end of the list, the operation reverses
   using as many extra elements as it needs from the front of the list. If
   the current position moves past the end of the list, it wraps around to
   the front. Lengths larger than the size of the list are invalid.

   Here's an example using a smaller list:

   Suppose we instead only had a circular list containing five elements,
   0, 1, 2, 3, 4 , and were given input lengths of 3, 4, 1, 5 .
     * The list begins as [0] 1 2 3 4 (where square brackets indicate the
       current position ).
     * The first length, 3 , selects ([0] 1 2) 3 4 (where parentheses
       indicate the sublist to be reversed).
     * After reversing that section ( 0 1 2 into 2 1 0 ), we get ([2] 1 0)
       3 4 .
     * Then, the current position moves forward by the length , 3 , plus
       the skip size , 0: 2 1 0 [3] 4 . Finally, the skip size increases
       to 1 .

     * The second length, 4 , selects a section which wraps: 2 1) 0 ([3] 4
       .
     * The sublist 3 4 2 1 is reversed to form 1 2 4 3 : 4 3) 0 ([1] 2 .
     * The current position moves forward by the length plus the skip size
       , a total of 5 , causing it not to move because it wraps around: 4
       3 0 [1] 2 . The skip size increases to 2 .

     * The third length, 1 , selects a sublist of a single element, and so
       reversing it has no effect.
     * The current position moves forward by the length ( 1 ) plus the
       skip size ( 2 ): 4 [3] 0 1 2 . The skip size increases to 3 .

     * The fourth length, 5 , selects every element starting with the
       second: 4) ([3] 0 1 2 . Reversing this sublist ( 3 0 1 2 4 into 4 2
       1 0 3 ) produces: 3) ([4] 2 1 0 .
     * Finally, the current position moves forward by 8 : 3 4 2 1 [0] .
       The skip size increases to 4 .

   In this example, the first two numbers in the list end up being 3 and 4
   ; to check the process, you can multiply them together to produce 12 .

   However, you should instead use the standard list size of 256 (with
   values 0 to 255 ) and the sequence of lengths in your puzzle input.
   Once this process is complete, what is the result of multiplying the
   first two numbers in the list ?
