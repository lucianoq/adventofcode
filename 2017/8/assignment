--- Day 8: I Heard You Like Registers ---

   You receive a signal directly from the CPU. Because of your recent
   assistance with [1]jump instructions , it would like you to compute the
   result of a series of unusual register instructions.

   Each instruction consists of several parts: the register to modify,
   whether to increase or decrease that register's value, the amount by
   which to increase or decrease it, and a condition. If the condition
   fails, skip the instruction without modifying the register. The
   registers all start at 0 . The instructions look like this:

   b inc 5 if a > 1
a inc 1 if b < 5
c dec -10 if a >= 1
c inc -20 if c == 10


   These instructions would be processed as follows:
     * Because a starts at 0 , it is not greater than 1 , and so b is not
       modified.
     * a is increased by 1 (to 1 ) because b is less than 5 (it is 0 ).
     * c is decreased by -10 (to 10 ) because a is now greater than or
       equal to 1 (it is 1 ).
     * c is increased by -20 (to -10 ) because c is equal to 10 .

   After this process, the largest value in any register is 1 .

   You might also encounter <= (less than or equal to) or != (not equal
   to). However, the CPU doesn't have the bandwidth to tell you what all
   the registers are named, and leaves that to you to determine.

   What is the largest value in any register after completing the
   instructions in your puzzle input?
