--- Day 18: Duet ---

   You discover a tablet containing some strange assembly code labeled
   simply " [1]Duet ". Rather than bother the sound card with it, you
   decide to run the code yourself. Unfortunately, you don't see any
   documentation, so you're left to figure out what the instructions mean
   on your own.

   It seems like the assembly is meant to operate on a set of registers
   that are each named with a single letter and that can each hold a
   single [2]integer . You suppose each register should start with a value
   of 0 .

   There aren't that many instructions, so it shouldn't be hard to figure
   out what they do. Here's what you determine:
     * snd X plays a sound with a frequency equal to the value of X .
     * set X Y sets register X to the value of Y .
     * add X Y increases register X by the value of Y .
     * mul X Y sets register X to the result of multiplying the value
       contained in register X by the value of Y .
     * mod X Y sets register X to the remainder of dividing the value
       contained in register X by the value of Y (that is, it sets X to
       the result of X [3]modulo Y ).
     * rcv X recovers the frequency of the last sound played, but only
       when the value of X is not zero. (If it is zero, the command does
       nothing.)
     * jgz X Y jumps with an offset of the value of Y , but only if the
       value of X is greater than zero . (An offset of 2 skips the next
       instruction, an offset of -1 jumps to the previous instruction, and
       so on.)

   Many of the instructions can take either a register (a single letter)
   or a number. The value of a register is the integer it contains; the
   value of a number is that number.

   After each jump instruction, the program continues with the instruction
   to which the jump jumped. After any other instruction, the program
   continues with the next instruction. Continuing (or jumping) off either
   end of the program terminates it.

   For example:

   set a 1
add a 2
mul a a
mod a 5
snd a
set a 0
rcv a
jgz a -1
set a 1
jgz a -2


     * The first four instructions set a to 1 , add 2 to it, square it,
       and then set it to itself modulo 5 , resulting in a value of 4 .
     * Then, a sound with frequency 4 (the value of a ) is played.
     * After that, a is set to 0 , causing the subsequent rcv and jgz
       instructions to both be skipped ( rcv because a is 0 , and jgz
       because a is not greater than 0 ).
     * Finally, a is set to 1 , causing the next jgz instruction to
       activate, jumping back two instructions to another jump, which
       jumps again to the rcv , which ultimately triggers the recover
       operation.

   At the time the recover operation is executed, the frequency of the
   last sound played is 4 .

   What is the value of the recovered frequency (the value of the most
   recently played sound) the first time a rcv instruction is executed
   with a non-zero value?
