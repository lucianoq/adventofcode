--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---

   A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to
   use a passphrase instead of simply a pass word . A passphrase consists
   of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.

   To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

   For example:
     * aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
     * aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
     * aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.

   The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input.
   How many passphrases are valid?
